################# Task ##########################
During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter
doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is Indian/Mahe.

Correct the mismatch.

############### Solution ################

step 1: Login to each of the application servers
    a: ssh tony@172.16.238.10
    b: ssh steve@172.16.238.11
    c: ssh banner@172.16.238.12

Step 2: Set timezone Indian/Mahe
    a: check which timezone is currently set: "sudo timedatectl | grep Time"

Step 3: Set timezone Indian/Mahe
    a: execute on each server: "sudo timedatectl set-timezone Indian/Mahe"
    b: check if timezone applied: "sudo timedatectl | grep Time"
